# RealTime SystemC - E2I

## What is this?

This is a repository containing all the programs I’ve written for my various programming classes during my E2I course. It’s intended mainly as a backup in case anything happens to my computer, but if it’s useful to you that’s great.

## Compiling

In order to compile the programs provided in this repository you'll need g++ and SystemC.
